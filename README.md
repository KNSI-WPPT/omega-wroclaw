# Omega Wroclaw
_City of Wroc≈Çaw publishes lots of open data, make use of it, somehow..._

## Project Overview
Project will be split into separate parts, each solving one of emerging problems:

 - **Crawling** - Public data needs to be downloaded, somehow.
 - **Formatting** - Almost each data source has different format, we should unify this.
 - **Backup** - Well, we all know that something always might go wrong, so prepare for that.
 - **Visualization** - Nobody likes raw data files, so lets draw something... on the city map.
 - **Learning** - Use machine learning to gather new data from existing sources.
